# eitherOr
This is basically an extended joke between my wife and I. One day we were trying to decide on dinner (cook at home or go out) and I suggested flipping a coin, then stated "I can code that!" She encouraged me to. Since then we've decided things with me coding and I've built more sophisticated syntax and started putting the things we want in rather than just heads or tails. This project is the full buildout of that idea.

### How it's made:
tech used: HTML, CSS, client side JavaScript

HTML provides a form for users to enter the two choices they want to decide from. Client side JavaScript provides a random selection between the two items and then provides the selection to the DOM. Minor styling via CSS. 
I borrowed a CSS coin animation from  https://codepen.io/bill0x2A/pen/LYbqZJj 

### Optimizations

This is a long term work in progress. I've posted in a pretty rough state, but everything I want for the actual choices is in place. There's a lot to be done "looks" wise. 

### Lessons Learned
- JavaScript syntax for seeking and returning values from input fields.
- I chose to use if/else syntax rather than ternary syntax due to the length of code returning values from input fields
- reminded about CSS syntax for borders.
